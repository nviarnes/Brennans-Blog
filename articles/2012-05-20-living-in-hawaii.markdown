Hi, Ive lived in <a href="http://www.gohawaii.com/">Hawaii</a> all my life, it's pretty excellent!

People walk around in bikinis and swim trunks all the time and go swimming and party. 
 
It's pretty cool to live near the volcanoes too, however one time a friend of mine fell in a volcano and got burned pretty badly....It was a pretty big bummer.

Our diet consists of lots of fruit and fish because we're on an island near the equator.

My favorite activities are <a href="http://www.wannasurf.com/spot/North_America/USA/Hawaii/Oahu/">surfing</a> and <a href="http://www.hawaiiskindiver.com/">spear fishing</a> on the beautiful Hawaiian coast!
